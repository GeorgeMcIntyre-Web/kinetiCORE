## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **1. UserLevel Type System**
```typescript
export type UserLevel = 'essential' | 'professional' | 'expert';
```
Clean, simple enum-style type for compile-time safety.

### **2. React Context Pattern**
```typescript
const { userLevel, setUserLevel } = useUserLevel();
```
Accessible from any component without prop drilling.

### **3. Conditional Rendering**
```typescript
{userLevel !== 'essential' && <AdvancedFeature />}
{userLevel === 'expert' && <ExpertFeature />}
```
Simple, readable pattern for progressive disclosure.

### **4. State Cleanup**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (userLevel !== 'expert' && coordinateMode === 'custom') {
    setCoordinateMode('local');
    setCustomFrame(null);
  }
}, [userLevel]);
```
Prevents stale state when switching levels.
